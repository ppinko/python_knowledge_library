TASK 1
Every week a computer scientist buys four lotto tickets. She always chooses the 
same prime numbers, with the hope that if she ever hits the jackpot, she will 
be able to go onto TV and Facebook and tell everyone her secret. This will 
suddenly create widespread public interest in prime numbers, and will be the 
trigger event that ushers in a new age of enlightenment. She represents her 
weekly tickets in Python as a list of lists.
a) Each lotto draw takes six random balls, numbered from 1 to 49. Write a 
function to return a lotto draw.
b) Write a function that compares a single ticket and a draw, and returns the 
number of correct picks on that ticket.
c) Write a function that takes a list of tickets and a draw, and returns a list 
telling how many picks were correct on each ticket.
d) Write a function that takes a list of integers, and returns the number of 
primes in the list.
e) Write a function to discover whether the computer scientist has missed any 
prime numbers in her selection of the four tickets. Return a list of all primes 
that she has missed
f) Write a function that repeatedly makes a new draw, and compares the draw to 
the four tickets
Count how many draws are needed until one of the computer 
scientistâ€™s tickets has at least 3 correct picks. Try the experiment twenty 
times, and average out the number of draws needed.
